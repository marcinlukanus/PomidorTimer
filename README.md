# PomidorTimer
The Pomodoro Technique is a time-management method that breaks down time in 25 minute work/study sessions followed by 5 minute breaks in order to maximize productivity.

This app creates a 25 minute count down timer, in which the user should study for the duration of. After that timer ends, a 5 minute count down timer begins as a break. These timers loop until the user cancels the timer.
